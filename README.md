This repository is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand core Python concepts through practical examples. It includes a variety of scripts organized into thematic folders, covering fundamental programming topics like basic programs, data structures, and loops. The project is a personal learning log for Utkarsh Dubey and a resource for anyone looking to explore Python with hands-on coding.
🚀 Features

✅ Organized Structure: Code is divided into folders like basic_programs, data_structures, and loops_demo for easy navigation.
🌱 Beginner-Friendly: Simple, well-commented scripts to help new programmers learn Python.
🧠 Core Concepts: Covers essential topics such as variables, loops, functions, and data structures.
🖐️ Hands-On Learning: Practical examples to reinforce theoretical knowledge.
📦 No Dependencies: Most scripts use only the Python standard library, making them easy to run.

🛠️ Installation
To use the scripts in this repository, you need Python installed on your system. Follow these steps:

No Additional Dependencies:The scripts in this repository are written using the Python standard library, so no external packages are required.


▶️ Usage
Each script in the repository is standalone and can be executed directly. To run a script, navigate to its folder and use the Python interpreter:
python script_name.py

Example:
cd basic_programs
python hello_world.py

Explore the folders to find scripts for specific topics:

📂 basic_programs/: Simple programs like printing patterns, basic calculations, etc.
