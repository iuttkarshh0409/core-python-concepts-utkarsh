## 📖 About the Project
This repository is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand core Python concepts through practical examples. It includes a variety of scripts organized into thematic folders, covering fundamental programming topics like basic programs, data structures, and loops. The project is a personal learning log for Utkarsh Dubey and a resource for anyone looking to explore Python with hands-on coding.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Organized Structure**: Code is divided into folders like `basic_programs`, `data_structures`, and `loops_demo` for easy navigation.
- 🌱 **Beginner-Friendly**: Simple, well-commented scripts to help new programmers learn Python.
- 🧠 **Core Concepts**: Covers essential topics such as variables, loops, functions, and data structures.
- 🖐️ **Hands-On Learning**: Practical examples to reinforce theoretical knowledge.
- 📦 **No Dependencies**: Most scripts use only the Python standard library, making them easy to run.

## 🛠️ Installation
To use the scripts in this repository, you need Python installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iuttkarshh0409/python-core-utkarsh.git
   cd python-core-utkarsh
   ```

2. **Install Python**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if needed.

3. **No Additional Dependencies**:
   The scripts in this repository are written using the Python standard library, so no external packages are required.

## ▶️ Usage
Each script in the repository is standalone and can be executed directly. To run a script, navigate to its folder and use the Python interpreter:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Example:
```bash
cd basic_programs
python hello_world.py
```

Explore the folders to find scripts for specific topics:
- 📂 `basic_programs/`: Simple programs like printing patterns, basic calculations, etc.
- 📂 `data_structures/`: Examples of lists, dictionaries, sets, and other data structures.
- 📂 `loops_demo/`: Demonstrations of loops (for, while) with practical examples.

Check the comments within each script for detailed instructions on its purpose and usage.
